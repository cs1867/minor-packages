# Minor Packages

Scripts to download external Opensearch packages the perfSONAR project requires but aren't available standard repos.
These files are also too big to store in git, hence the download.

Able to grab both debian and RPM packages in theory. Update the .yml file with location of desired RPM. Update the Makefile
if you need to grab new packages.
