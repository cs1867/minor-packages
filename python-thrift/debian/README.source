The Thrift project creates monolithic release artifacts that include the
compiler, and a considerable number of language libraries.  For practical
reasons, this monolithic archive is repackaged into smaller components for
inclusion in Debian as indiviual source packages.

Source for the tools used to repackage Thrift releases can be found at
