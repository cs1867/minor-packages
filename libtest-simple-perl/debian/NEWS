  From upstream Changes:

  0.95_01  Wed Mar  3 15:36:59 PST 2010

    Feature Changes
    * is() and others will no longer stringify its arguments before
      comparing.  Overloaded objects will make use of their eq
      overload rather than their "" overload.  This can break tests of
      impolitely string overloaded objects.  DateTime prior to 0.54 is
      the biggest example.
